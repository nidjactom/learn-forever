Help on module locale:

NAME
    locale - Locale support module.

DESCRIPTION
    The module provides low-level access to the C lib's locale APIs and adds high
    level number formatting APIs as well as a locale aliasing engine to complement
    these.
    
    The aliasing engine includes support for many commonly used locale names and
    maps them to values suitable for passing to the C lib's setlocale() function. It
    also includes default encodings for all supported locale names.
